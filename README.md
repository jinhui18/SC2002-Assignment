# SC2002-Assignment

This is our school's assignment for the module SC2002, Object Oriented Design and Programming.

The objective of this project is to apply the Object Oriented (OO) Concepts that we have learnt to model, design, and develop an OO Application.
In this project, we have created a Hotel Reservation and Payment System (HRPS), which is an application to computerize the processes of making hotel reservations, recording of orders, and displaying of records. The key objective of adopting OO design concepts is to minimize the impact of changes by managing dependencies, which is key to developing a modular and robust application. Therefore, through this report, our team will be using the various OO design principles and concepts to analyse the design approaches that we have adopted in the development of the application, and ultimately the robustness of our application.
